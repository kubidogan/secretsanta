# What I would improve:

## - Currently the application is not sending the invite to user after adding them to the group.
## - Use Devise:Invitable to impliment invitations and allow users to sign in.
## - Add JS or Stimulus to create modal pop ups for forms.
## - Intigrate API for gifts website for users to pick from depending on budget.
## - Style the front-end using React or Tailwind for clear code.
## - Refactor Logic within the users controller.
